# ARM ITI Final Project (AlQuranCast)

# Overview
Introducing "AlQuranCast," a Quran casting radio channel that aims to bring the beauty of the Quran to listeners in an innovative way.

# Key Features
Our project leverages cutting-edge ARM technology to create a seamless experience for users. Here's a glimpse into what we've accomplished:

## ðŸ“º Display Technology: 
We integrated LCD 16x2 and TFT displays to ensure clear and vibrant visuals, enhancing the user experience.

## ðŸ’¡ Interactive Features: 
LED matrices and LEDs were strategically incorporated to indicate the selected channel, adding a tactile element to the user interface.

## ðŸ”˜ User Control: 
Pushbuttons allow users to effortlessly switch between channels, putting the power of choice directly in their hands.

## ðŸ“¡ Communication Protocols: 
Leveraging USART, we established communication between two microcontrollers. The transmitting microcontroller (TX) efficiently controls the LCD, TFT, and buttons, while the receiving microcontroller (RX) seamlessly processes signals to control the LED matrix and LEDs.
